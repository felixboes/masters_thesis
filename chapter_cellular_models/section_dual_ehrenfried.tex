\section{The Dual Ehrenfried Complex [B]}
\label{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried}
In this section, we introduce the notion of coboundary traces to provide explicit formulas for both the horizontal coface operator $(\del'')^\ast$ and
the coboundary operator $\del_\E^\ast$.
Moreover, we study some usefull properties of $\kappa^\ast$ and classify the cells of a given Ehrenfried complex.

Let us sketch the process of constructing horizontal cofaces of a given top dimensional cell $\Sigma = \inhom$.
Every transposition defines a slit of pairs where shorter slits sit atop of longer slits if they are of the same height.
In some pictures (e.g.\ Lemma \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:f_dual_of_a_cell}), we indicate this pairing by an arc joining the two slits.
In Figure \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:motivate_coboundaries_pre} we picture the cell $\Sigma = ((\ul3\ \ul1)|(\ul2\ \ul1))$.
\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{\label{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:motivate_coboundaries_pre}The cell $((\ul3\ \ul1)|(\ul2\ \ul1))$. Here $g=1$, $n=1$ and $m=0$.}
\end{figure}

We obtain a coboundary by glueing a stripe inbetween the two slits of height $\ul 1$.
More sophisticated, we let the shorter slit jump through the longer slit, in order to end up below the long slit of height $\ul2$, and glue in the stripe afterwards.
The two coboundaries are sketched in Figure \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:motivate_coboundaries} where we shade the stripe which was glued in.

\end{figure}

For a cell with more slits we might have more choices for jumps as seen in the next example.
The cell $\Sigma = \big( (\ul4\ \ul1) | (\ul3\ \ul1) | (\ul3\ \ul1) | (\ul2\ \ul 1) \big)$ is skeched in Figure \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:motivate_more_coboundaries_pre}
\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}
and we construct the three coboundaries seen in Figure \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:motivate_more_coboundaries}.
To obtain coboundary (1), we let slits 2, 3 and 4 of height $\ul1$ jump through slit 1.
For coboundary (2), we let slits 3 and 4 of height $\ul1$ jump through slit 2,
and for coboundary (3), we slits 2  and 3 of height $\ul1$ jump through slit 1.

\end{figure}

The key insight is that an $i\Th$ coboundary $\tilde\Sigma$ is determined by its sequence $\tilde\sigma_j(i)$.
By this, we see that constructing a coboundary should be the same as constructing such a sequence by choosing which slits are going to jump.
We encode our geometric intuition in the notion of $i\Th$ coboundary trace (see Definition \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:cob_tr})
and show that the canonical map from the set of $i\Th$ coboundary traces $T_i(\Sigma)$ to the set of $i\Th$ cofaces $\cof_i(\Sigma)$ is bijective (see Proposition \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:cob_tr_equals_cob}).
The coface corresponding to a given coboundary trace $a$ is denoted by $a.\Sigma$.
Using our notation, the coboundary operator of the Ehrenfried complex is
\[
    \del_\E^\ast(\Sigma) = \sum_{i=1}^p (-1)^i \sum_{a \in T_i(\Sigma)} \kappa^\ast(a.\Sigma) \,.
\]
Most importantly the explicit formula and a better understanding of $\kappa^\ast$ (developed in Subsection \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:kappa_dual})
allows us to define homology operations on the moduli space via coboundary maps defined on the dual Ehrenfried complex, see Chapter \ref{homology_operations}.

Moreover, we classify the cells of a fixed Ehrenfried complex.
Cofaces $\tilde\Sigma$ are said to arise as basic expansions of $\Sigma$ if the construction involves no jumps, in the sense of the above paragraphs.
Cells that do not arise this way are called thin.
Applying basic expansions is commutative (this is made precise by Proposition \ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:basic_expansions_commute})
and every cell in $\E$ arises uniquely from a thin cell by applying a set of basic expansions:
\begin{prop*}[\ref{cellular_models:dual_ehrenfried:every_cell_is_an_expansion}]
    Denote the set of thin cells by $\Thin$, the set of basic expansions of a cell $\Sigma$ by $Bsupp(\Sigma)$ and the power set operator by $\mc Pow$.
    There is a bijection
    \[
        ex \colon \coprod_{\Sigma \in \Thin} \mc Pow( Bsupp(\Sigma)) \to Cells(\E) \mspc{with}{20} Bsupp(\Sigma) \supseteq J \mapsto J.\Sigma \,.
    \]
\end{prop*}
In particular, the number of cells of a given degree is the sum of certain binomial coefficients and the dimension of $\E$ is
\[
    \dim \E = \sum_{p=2}^{2h} 2^{(2h-p)} \cdot |\{\Sigma \in \E_p \text{ thin} \}| \,.
\]
