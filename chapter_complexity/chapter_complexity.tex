\chapter{On the Computational Complexity}
\label{complexity}
This chapter serves as a brief review on nearby complexity concerns.
The first section explains why computation require much space even for small valued for $h$ --- which is $h = 2g-2+m+n+r$ in the parallel case and $h=2g-2+m+n$ in the radial case ---
whereas the second section explains why computations require much time.
